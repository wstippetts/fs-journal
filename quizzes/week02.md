**4.** Given this array: 
```js
let fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'pineapple',  'orange', 'strawberry']
``` 
What index is the pineapple's current position? How do you know?
```
- 2, because it is 3rd in the array and the first array position is '0'
```
**5.** With these two objects: 
```js
let you = { name:"You", hair: true, friends: [] }
let them = { name:"Them", hair: false, friends: [] }
```

```
- them[name:"Them", hair: false, friends: []].push(you[])
```

**6.** Give an example of a JavaScript `Conditional`:
```
- if(x > Y){}
```
**7.** In the `for loop` below, what is the name of the piece belongs inside the empty "______" space? What would you put here to increase `i` by one on every iteration?
```js
for ( let i = 0; i < arr.length; _______ ) {
  //...
```
