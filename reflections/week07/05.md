Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

  slowly figuring out how to split up large things into many small things
- What are you struggling with?
  not getting a duck
