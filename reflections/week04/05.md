# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
  - projects from week 2 are crazy easy now 
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
  - 
- What are you struggling with?
  - too dependant on references and I am so slow at building up the projects
- What would you count as a victory?
  - I do feel like I grasp everything but getting it out of my head without reference is difficult.
