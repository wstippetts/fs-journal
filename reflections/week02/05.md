# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

I am really hoping every week is as fluid as the last 2 weeks. I am really enjoying my time here.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    - writing html with JS is pretty nice
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
    - JS so far is not nearly as bad as everyone has been making it out to be
- What are you struggling with?
    - spending too much time making things pretty (and they still are not pretty)
- What would you count as a victory?
  - another week almost done.
