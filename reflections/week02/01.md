## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
  - area of a program a variable is visable.
2. What is Hoisting ?
- jumping a variable to the top of its scope. allowing it to be used ahead of where it was created in the code.
3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
- const is a variable that you do not change 'CONSTANT' var sucks so we'll use let. Fortunately I do not have to worry about int, float, double, ect. I'm told let does all.
