## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?
- SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability in which an attacker can manipulate user input to inject SQL commands into an application's database query
2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?
- In-band SQLi (Classic SQLi): This is the most common and straightforward type of SQL injection attack. It involves directly injecting SQL commands into input fields or URLs, allowing attackers to retrieve or modify data in the database.

Blind SQLi: In a blind SQLi attack, attackers do not receive any information directly from the database, so they use techniques to infer data by sending queries that generate a true/false response. This can be done through various techniques such as time-based, error-based, or boolean-based SQL injection.

Out-of-band SQLi: Out-of-band SQLi attacks use a different channel to retrieve data from the database. This method usually involves using SQL commands to send an HTTP request to a server controlled by the attacker, allowing them to extract data indirectly. This type of SQLi attack is less common but can be more difficult to detect as it does not rely on responses from the victim's server.
3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?
- SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into an application's database query, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or even taking control of the database. Here are some ways to detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks:

Input validation: The first step in preventing SQL injection is to validate user input on the server-side. This can involve checking for malicious characters, such as semicolons, apostrophes, and quotes, and rejecting any input that contains them.

Parameterized queries: Parameterized queries are a way to pass user input as a parameter rather than concatenating it directly into the SQL statement. This approach prevents attackers from injecting SQL code into the query, as the input is treated as a parameter rather than as part of the query itself.

Escape characters: Another way to sanitize user input is to escape any special characters before inserting them into the SQL query. This involves adding a backslash () before characters that could be used to inject SQL code, such as single quotes.

Limit permissions: It's also important to limit the permissions of the database user to reduce the potential damage that a SQL injection attack could cause. For example, the database user should only have access to the specific tables and data that are necessary for the application to function.

Logging and monitoring: Finally, it's important to log and monitor database activity to detect any suspicious activity, such as a high volume of failed login attempts or unusual query patterns. This can help identify SQL injection attacks and other security threats.
