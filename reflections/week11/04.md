## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

As a software development course student for the past 10 weeks, I have been introduced to various technologies such as Vue and Bootstrap for frontend development, .NET for backend development, and MySQL for database management. The course has been challenging, but it has also been a great learning experience.

Throughout the course, my main concern has been managing my time effectively. There have been moments where I felt overwhelmed with the amount of information I was learning, and I had to prioritize my tasks to ensure that I was meeting deadlines. However, I have been able to manage my time well by breaking down the course material into manageable chunks and creating a study schedule that works for me.

Looking forward to the final project, I plan to use the skills and knowledge I have gained so far to create a functional and user-friendly application. I intend to dedicate enough time to brainstorming, designing, and implementing my project to ensure that I deliver a high-quality end product.

Despite the challenges, I have enjoyed most about the course up to this point is the hands-on experience. The course has provided me with the opportunity to work on various projects, which has allowed me to apply the concepts I have learned in class to real-life scenarios. Additionally, the course instructors have been supportive, providing guidance and feedback that has been valuable in my learning journey.

Overall, I am grateful for the experience I have gained in this software development course. The skills and knowledge I have acquired have not only improved my technical capabilities, but they have also given me confidence in my ability to take on challenging projects.
