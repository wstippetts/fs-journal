## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
  - A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a database table. It is a column or a combination of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row. A primary key cannot be null (empty), and it must have a unique value for each row in the table.
2. What is an `Alias`?
  - An alias is an alternative name or label given to a table or column in a database query. It allows you to refer to a table or column with a different name than the one given to it in the database schema.
  or in a broader use: 
  An alias is a different name or reference to the same variable or data type. It is often used to make code more readable or to create shorter and more convenient ways of referring to a variable or data type.
3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)



```
SELECT pat.name AS patient_name, app.appointment_date
FROM appointments app
JOIN patients pat ON app.patient_id = pat.id
WHERE app.doctor_id = 2;
