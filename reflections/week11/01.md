## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
  - It allows you to create new classes (derived classes) that inherit properties and methods from existing classes
2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?
  - In C#, a derived class inherits all members (properties, methods, fields, events, indexers, and delegates) of the base class, with a few exceptions:
  - does not inherit constructors, static members or private members 
3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?
  - Accessibility, which is determined by access modifiers, affects inheritance in C# by controlling which members of the base class are visible and accessible to the derived class. There are four access modifiers in C#: public, protected, internal, and private. Here's how each of them affects inheritance:

public: Public members of the base class are accessible to any derived class, regardless of whether the derived class is in the same assembly or a different one. These members can be accessed, overridden, or hidden by the derived class as needed.

protected: Protected members of the base class are accessible only to the derived class and any further derived classes in the same assembly or a different one. Similar to public members, protected members can be accessed, overridden, or hidden by the derived class.

internal: Internal members of the base class are accessible to any derived class within the same assembly, but not to derived classes in a different assembly. If a derived class has access to an internal member, it can access, override, or hide it, just like public or protected members.

private: Private members of the base class are not directly accessible to the derived class. They are still inherited, but the derived class can only access them through public, protected, or internal methods, properties, or indexers that expose them.
